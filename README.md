# Edilitics Task ~ StockWave

This project is a "data visuaisation website" which uses the core d3 package (d3) to display stock market data.

The data is retrieved from Supabase according to the company selected by the user. Supabase was used as a medium to store data as live data retrieval using api required money or had fewer api calls for free.


## Features Implemented

  - Tooltip: Display data details when hovering over a data point.
  - Zoom & Pan: Allow users to zoom and explore chart details.
  - Data Labels: Show values directly on data points or bars.
  - Custom Themes: Implement a light/dark mode or color customization.

## Bonus (Optional Enhancements for Extra Credit)
  - Animations & Transitions: Smooth element movement on update.
  - Dark Mode Support.
  - Multi-chart dashboard: Combining a candlestick and bar chart.
  - Live Deployment on Vercel,
